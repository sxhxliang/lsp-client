## `lsp-client`: a rust client for the [language-server-protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md).

This software is **experimental**, and in no way ready for use. However, it may be useful as an example, and it may become more useful over time.

This project exists to provide a framework for experimenting with plugin support in the [xi editor](https://github.com/google/xi-editor).
